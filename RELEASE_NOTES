This is the 1.01 release of the Dada Engine.

1.01 is a bugfix release, which fixes a problem with regular
expression substitutions in 1.0.

This program has been gotten to compile successfully on the following
platforms:  Linux, MIPS ULTRIX, Irix 5.3, Solaris 2.x and Digital UNIX 3.2.  
Your mileage may vary.

Under some systems, such as ULTRIX and Solaris, the installation script 
("make install") may not work properly.  If this is the case, run the
"inst" script that is created, with "sh inst".

If you have problems making it, try using GNU make.  SGI's make, for
example, had some problems.
